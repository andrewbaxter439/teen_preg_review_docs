The purposes of this study were to (a) examine qualitative studies on adolescent preg- nancy and determine methods used; (b) describe and analyze primary ﬁndings; (c) develop and de- ﬁne common themes across studies; and (d) rec- ommend need for further qualitative research based on the review.","

Potential articles were obtained by accessing the following computer databases: Cumulative In- dex for Allied Health and Nursing (CINAHL), Psychological Literature (PsycINFO), PubMed, EMBASE, Social Work Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, and ERIC.
