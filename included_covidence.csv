Condom Availability Programs in Schools: A Review of the Literature,"Andrzejewski, J.; Liddon, N.; Leonard, S.","OBJECTIVE: This review synthesizes findings from the peer-reviewed evaluation literature on condom availability programs (CAPs) in secondary schools. DATA SOURCE: Peer-reviewed evaluation literature indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, ERIC, CINAHL, Sociological Abstracts, SCOPUS, and POPLINE. STUDY INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Manuscripts had to be, written in English, and report evaluation data from a US school-based CAP. DATA EXTRACTION: Articles were coded independently by 2 authors. Discrepancies were resolved through open discussion. DATA SYNTHESIS: We grouped findings into outcome evaluation and process evaluation findings. Outcome evaluation findings included sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pregnancy rates, condom use, contraception use, sexual risk, and substance use. Process evaluation findings included awareness of CAPs, attitudes toward CAPs, attitudes toward condoms, and receipt of education and instruction. RESULTS: Of the 138 citations reviewed, 12 articles published between 1995 and 2012 met the inclusion criteria, representing 8 programs. Evaluations indicate CAPs yield condom acquisition rates between 23% and 48%, have mixed results related to condom use, and are not associated with increases in sexual and other risk behaviors. One program found CAPs were associated with a decrease in a combined rate of chlamydia and gonorrhea. One program found no association between CAPs and unintended pregnancy. Students' attitudes toward CAPs were favorable and awareness was high. CONCLUSIONS: Condom availability programs are accepted by students and can be an appropriate and relevant school-based intervention for teens. Condom availability programs can increase condom use, but more evaluations are needed on CAP impact on rates of HIV, STIs, and unintended pregnancy.",2018,Aug-01,Am J Health Promot,,,8.90117E+14,30068218,10.1177/0890117118791118,,#349,Andrzejewski 2018,Meigan Thomson (2020-06-19 20:42:34)(Select): needs full text; ,
Hormonal and intrauterine methods for contraception for women aged 25 years and younger,"Tang, J. H.; Lopez, L. M.; Mody, S.; Grimes, D. A.","Women between the ages of 15 and 24 years have high rates of unintended pregnancy; over half of women in this age group want to avoid pregnancy. However, women under age 25 years have been found to have higher typical contraceptive failure rates within the first 12 months of use than older women. High discontinuation rates may also be a problem in this population. Concern that adolescents and young women will not find hormonal or intrauterine contraceptives acceptable or effective might deter healthcare providers from recommending these contraceptive methods.  This review examined randomized controlled trials of hormonal or intrauterine methods used for contraception in women aged 25 years and younger. In February 2012, we searched the computerized databases Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, POPLINE, CINAHL, and LILACS for randomized controlled trials that compared hormonal or intrauterine methods used for contraception in women aged 25 years and younger. We also searched for current trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We considered all randomized controlled trials in any language that reported the contraceptive failure rates for hormonal or intrauterine contraceptive methods, when compared to another contraceptive method, for women aged 25 years and younger. The other contraceptive method could be another intrauterine method, another hormonal method, or a non-hormonal method. Treatment duration must have been at least three months. The first author extracted the data and entered the information into RevMan. Another author performed an independent data extraction and verified the initial entry. Because of disparate contraceptive exposures, we were not able to combine the studies in meta-analysis. Four trials met the inclusion criteria. The trials compared the combined oral contraceptive versus the transdermal contraceptive patch, the combined oral contraceptive versus the vaginal contraceptive ring, the combined oral contraceptive versus the levonorgestrel intrauterine system, and the levonorgestrel intrauterine system versus the copper T380A intrauterine device. Because of small numbers of participants, the trials were not informative regarding contraceptive efficacy. Data on continuation rates were also limited. In one of these trials, the levonorgestrel intrauterine system was found to have a similar 12-month continuation rate as the combined oral contraceptive (odds ratio (OR) 1.48; 95% CI 0.76 to 2.89). In that trial, a higher proportion of women discontinued the levonorgestrel intrauterine system because of pain (OR 14.62; 95% CI 0.81 to 263.16), whereas a higher proportion of women discontinued the combined oral contraceptive for personal reasons (OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.85). Current evidence is insufficient to compare contraceptive efficacy and continuation rates for hormonal and intrauterine methods in women aged 25 years and younger. Limited data suggests that the levonorgestrel intrauterine system may be an acceptable alternative to the combined oral contraceptive in this population.",2012,Nov-14,Cochrane database of systematic reviews (Online),11,,CD009805,23152281,10.1002/14651858.CD009805.pub2,,#15,Tang 2012,Meigan Thomson (2020-06-20 00:01:07)(Select): i have said to exclude - as some of the studies are out of your age range and region (i noticed they have done searches in LILAC) - unless you plan to go through the entire document and read through the individual studies? they surmise the data together; ,
Views of contraceptive service delivery to young people in the UK: A systematic review and thematic synthesis,"Baxter, S.; Blank, L.; Guillaume, L.; Squires, H.; Payne, N.","Background and methodology: Despite widespread availability of contraceptives and increasing service provision in the UK, rates of teenage pregnancy remain a concern. It has been suggested that young people face particular obstacles in accessing services, leading to a need for specialist provision. This systematic review examined the literature reporting views of service providers and young people. Data were synthesised in order to develop key themes to inform the development of contraceptive services for this population. Results: A total of 59 papers reporting studies carried out within the UK were included. Forty-five of these provided qualitative or mixed method data and 14 reported survey findings. Seven key themes were identified: perceptions of services; accessibility; embarrassment; anonymity and confidentiality; the clinic environment; the consultation; and service organisation. Conclusions: This review suggests that the most significant concern for young people is the preservation of anonymity and confidentiality. There seems to be a need for young people to be given greater assurances about this, with process and environmental changes suggested. The fear of staff being critical or unfriendly also presents a considerable obstacle to some young people. Issues of service accessibility - such as convenience of location and opening hours - are also highlighted, with lifestyle factors and restrictions on where under-18s can go suggested as important aspects. The review suggests that varying preferences among young people with regard to which service to access requires choice to be preserved and, where possible, extended. This requires services to work effectively together to consider provision across a locality.",2011,,Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care,37,2,71-84,,10.1136/jfprhc.2010.0014,,#303,Baxter 2011,Andrew Baxter (2020-06-15 21:02:34)(Select): I think this should have been exclude - no relevant outcomes. don't know why still in?; ,
Contraception for adolescents after abortion,"Sedlecky, K.; Stanković, Z.","Introduction Preventing repeated unplanned pregnancy among adolescents is still a challenge because many of them fail to use effective contraception after abortion.Objective To review currently recommended options of methods and counselling for effective prevention of repeat pregnancies in adolescents.Methods Review of the literature that was identified through the Medline, ScienceDirect, Google and Popline databases and relevant expert opinions.Results Counselling needs to be adapted to the needs, values and lifestyle of adolescents. The best results are achieved with nondirective or active contraceptive counselling, followed by regular check-ups and cautious and attentive approach in the management of doubts, prejudices and side effects related to the contraceptive chosen. Adolescents should initiate contraception immediately after abortion: the motivation for choosing an efficacious method is highest at that time; resumption of ovulation following induced abortion occurs on average after three weeks; more than half of these girls will resume sexual activity within two weeks after pregnancy termination. Long-acting reversible contraception use during adolescence is safe and most effective. However, achieving a high long-term continuation rate is especially challenging in adolescents; this is due to developmental and environmental characteristics that influence their contraceptive behaviour.Conclusion Adolescents should immediately after abortion initiate a reliable contraceptive method, preferably one whose efficacy is not user-dependent. Providing an appropriate health care would contribute to achieving continuity in the prevention of repeat pregnancy. © 2015 The European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health.",2016,,European Journal of Contraception and Reproductive Health Care,21,1,Apr-14,,10.3109/13625187.2015.1082175,,#44,Sedlecky 2016,,
School-Based Interventions Going beyond Health Education to Promote Adolescent Health: Systematic Review of Reviews,"Shackleton, N.; Jamal, F.; Viner, R. M.; Dickson, K.; Patton, G.; Bonell, C.","Purpose Health education in school classrooms can be effective in promoting sexual health and preventing violence and substance use but effects are patchy and often short term. Classroom education is also challenging because of schools' increasing focus on academic-performance metrics. Other school-based approaches are possible, such as healthy school policies, improving how schools respond to bullying, and parent outreach, which go beyond health education to address broader health determinants. Existing systematic reviews include such interventions but often alongside traditional health education. There is scope for a systematic review of reviews to assess and synthesize evidence across existing reviews to develop an overview of the potential of alternative school-based approaches. Methods We searched 12 databases to identify reviews published after 1980. Data were reviewed by two researchers. Quality was assessed using a modified Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews checklist and results were synthesized narratively. Results We screened 7,544 unique references and included 22 reviews. Our syntheses suggest that multicomponent school-based interventions, for example, including school policy changes, parent involvement, and work with local communities, are effective for promoting sexual health and preventing bullying and smoking. There is less evidence that such intervention can reduce alcohol and drug use. Economic incentives to keep girls in school can reduce teenage pregnancies. School clinics can promote smoking cessation. There is little evidence that, on their own, sexual-health clinics, antismoking policies, and various approaches targeting at-risk students are effective. Conclusions There is good evidence that various whole-school health interventions are effective in preventing teenage pregnancy, smoking, and bullying. © 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

The effect of follow-up visits or contacts after contraceptive initiation on method continuation and correct use,"Steenland, M. W.; Zapata, L. B.; Brahmi, D.; Marchbanks, P. A.; Curtis, K. M.","Background: We conducted a systematic review to assess whether follow-up visits or contacts after a woman begins using contraception improve method continuation and correct use. Study Design: We searched the PubMed database for all peer-reviewed articles in any language published from database inception through May 2012 that examined the effect of a structured follow-up schedule of visits or contacts on contraceptive use. We included studies that compared women who initiated a method of contraception with a certain follow-up schedule compared to women with a different follow-up schedule or no follow-up at all. To be included, studies must have compared groups on a measure of contraceptive use (e.g., pregnancy, correct use, consistent use, method discontinuation including expulsion). Though not ideally suited to answer our review question, studies in which women used a variety of contraceptive methods but results were not stratified by method type were included. Results: Four studies met our inclusion criteria (Level I, poor to II-2, poor). Two studies examined the effect of a specific follow-up visit schedule on intrauterine device (IUD) continuation: one examining frequency of visits and one examining the timing of the first follow-up visit. Women with more frequent follow-up visits did not have a statistically significant difference in proportion of removals for medical reasons compared with women who had fewer follow-up visits; among women who had their IUDs removed for medical reasons, those who had more frequent follow-up visits had a longer mean time of use prior to removal. The other study found more removals and shorter continuation among women with a follow-up visit at 1 week compared to women with a follow-up visit at 1 month after IUD insertion (no statistical tests reported). Two studies examined the effect of follow-up phone calls compared to no follow-up phone calls after an initial family planning visit among adolescents initiating a variety of contraceptive methods. Neither of the two studies found any differences in method continuation or correct use between study groups. Conclusions: It is difficult to determine what effect, if any, follow-up visits or contacts have on contraceptive method continuation or correct use. Few studies were identified, and those that were identified were mostly of poor quality, were not method specific and had either poor patient compliance with follow-up visits or poor phone contact completion rates. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The effect of school-based health clinics on teenage pregnancy and parenting outcomes: an integrated literature review,"Strunk, J. A.","Teenage pregnancy outcomes have become an increasing concern in the United States. Education and support of pregnant teens are critical factors that may determine good or poor pregnancy outcomes. Poor outcomes may include low birth weight, developmental delays, and poor academic performance. Although the number of teenagers experiencing pregnancy and parenting has declined in the U.S., school-based health clinics can be used to provide support and guidance designed to avoid the negative outcomes associated with teenage pregnancy and parenting. By having school-based health clinics, nurse practitioners and school nurses can provide much needed services to pregnant and parenting teens. These services should include educational support, counseling, and community resources. This inquiry provides a metasynthesis of the literature and will review, examine, and summarize the literature relating to the effect of school-based clinics on teenage pregnancy and parenting outcomes.",2008,Feb,The Journal of school nursing,24,1,13-20,351504864,10.1177/10598405080240010301,,#20,Strunk 2008,,
"Effectiveness of peer education interventions for HIV prevention, adolescent pregnancy prevention and sexual health promotion for young people: A systematic review of European studies","Tolli, M. V.","Peer education remains a popular strategy for health promotion and prevention, but evidence of its effectiveness is still limited. This article presents a systematic review of peer education interventions in the European Union that were published between January 1999 and May 2010. The objective of the review is to determine the effectiveness of peer education programs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention, adolescent pregnancy prevention and promotion of sexual health among young people. Standardized methods of searching and data extraction were utilized and five studies were identified. Although a few statistically significant and non-significant changes were observed in the studies, it is concluded that, overall, when compared to standard practice or no intervention, there is no clear evidence of the effectiveness of peer education concerning HIV prevention, adolescent pregnancy prevention and sexual health promotion for young people in the member countries of the European Union. Further research is needed to determine factors that contribute to program effectiveness. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

Sexual abstinence only programmes to prevent HIV infection in high income countries: Systematic review,"Underhill, K.; Montgomery, P.; Operario, D.","Objective: To assess the effects of sexual abstinence only programmes for HIV prevention among participants in high income countries. Design: Systematic review. Data sources: 30 electronic databases without linguistic or geographical restrictions to February 2007, contacts with experts, hand searching, and cross referencing. Review methods: Two reviewers independently applied inclusion criteria and extracted data, resolving disagreements by consensus and referral to a third reviewer. Randomised and quasirandomised controlled trials of abstinence only programmes in any high income country were included. Programmes aimed to prevent HIV only or both pregnancy and HIV. Trials evaluated biological outcomes (incidence of HIV, sexually transmitted infection, pregnancy) or behavioural outcomes (incidence or frequency of unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex; incidence or frequency of any vaginal, anal, or oral sex; number of partners; condom use; sexual initiation). Results: The search identified 13 trials enrolling about 15 940 US youths. All outcomes were self reported. Compared with various controls, no programme affected incidence of unprotected vaginal sex, number of partners, condom use, or sexual initiation. One trial observed adverse effects at short term follow-up (sexually transmitted infections, frequency of sex) and long term follow-up (sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy) compared with usual care, but findings were offset by trials with non-significant results. Anothertrial observed a protective effect on incidence of vaginal sex compared with usual care, but this was limited to short term follow-up and countered by trials with non-significant findings.

Abstinence-plus programs for HIV infection prevention in high-income countries,"Underhill, K.; Montgomery, P.; Operario, D.","Background: Abstinence-plus interventions promote sexual abstinence as the best means of preventing acquisition of HIV, but also encourage safer-sex strategies (eg condom use) for sexually active participants. Objectives: To assess the effects of abstinence-plus programs for HIV prevention in high-income countries. Search strategy: We searched 30 electronic databases (eg CENTRAL, PubMed, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, PsycINFO) ending February 2007. Cross-referencing, hand-searching, and contacting experts yielded additional citations. Selection criteria: We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials evaluating abstinence-plus interventions in high-income countries (as defined by the World Bank). Interventions were any efforts that encouraged sexual abstinence as the best means of HIV prevention, but also promoted safer sex. Results were self-reported biological outcomes, behavioral outcomes, and HIV knowledge. Data collection and analysis: Three reviewers independently appraised 20070 citations and 325 full-text papers for inclusion and methodological quality; 39 evaluations were included. Due to heterogeneity and data unavailability, we presented the results of individual studies instead of a meta-analysis. Main results: Studies enrolled 37724 North American youth; participants were ethnically diverse. Programs took place in schools (10), community facilities (24), both schools and community facilities (2), healthcare facilities (2), and family homes (1). Median final follow-up occurred 12 months after baseline. Results showed no evidence that abstinence-plus programs can affect self-reported sexually transmitted infection (STI) incidence, and limited evidence that programs can reduce self-reported pregnancy incidence. Results for behavioral outcomes were promising; 23 of 39 evaluations found a significantly protective intervention effect for at least one behavioral outcome. Consistently favorable program effects were found for HIV knowledge. No adverse effects were observed. Several evaluations found that one version of an abstinence-plus program was more effective than another, suggesting that more research into intervention mechanisms is warranted. Methodological strengths included large samples and statistical controls for baseline values. Weaknesses included under-utilization of relevant outcomes, self-report bias, and analyses neglecting attrition and clustered randomization. Authors' conclusions: Many abstinence-plus programs appear to reduce short-term and long-term HIV risk behavior among youth in high-income countries. Evidence for program effects on biological measures is limited. Evaluations consistently show no adverse program effects for any outcomes, including the incidence and frequency of sexual activity. Trials comparing abstinence-only, abstinence-plus, and safer-sex interventions are needed. Copyright © 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Teenage-pregnancies from a human life history viewpoint - an updated review with special respect to prevention strategies,"Kirchengast, S.","Adolescence is life stage typical of Homo sapiens. Reproduction during adolescence, i.e. teenage pregnancies is still listed among the most important public health problems of the 21rst century, although low maternal age may be a marker for social rather than biological or medical disadvantage. Data from developed countries indicate that an optimal prenatal program eliminates obstetrical risks among adolescent mothers and adverse pregnancy outcome is mainly due to socioeconomic cofactors. Most teenage pregnancies are unplanned and result often in a social disaster. It is well documented that teenage mothers are more likely to drop out of school and have a low educational level. They are faced with unemployment and poverty. Consequently nearly all developed countries try to reduce teenage pregnancies and teenage motherhood effectively. The different countries however, use different strategies and these strategies differ regarding their effectiveness. In this review beside general aspects of pregnancies during adolescence, strategies to reduce teenage pregnancy rates are discussed. In particular the decline in teenage motherhood in Austria since the 1970s and is highlighted. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.",2012,,Current Women's Health Reviews,8,3,248-255,,10.2174/157340412803760685,,#132,Kirchengast 2012,,
"Systematic review of interventions to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, among young people in Europe","Lazarus, Jeffrey V; Sihvonen-Riemenschneider, Henna; Laukamm-Josten, Ulrich; Wong, Fiona; Liljestrand, Jerker","AIM: To examine the effectiveness of interventions seeking to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, among young people in the European Union. METHODS: For this systematic review, we examined interventions that aimed at STI risk reduction and health promotion conducted in schools, clinics, and in the community for reported effectiveness (in changing sexual behavior and/or knowledge) between 1995 and 2005. We also reviewed study design and intervention methodology to discover how these factors affected the results, and we compiled a list of characteristics associated with successful and unsuccessful programs. Studies were eligible if they employed a randomized control design or intervention-only design that examined change over time and measured behavioral, biologic, or certain psychosocial outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 19 studies that satisfied our review criteria, 11 reported improvements in the sexual health knowledge and/or attitudes of young people. Ten of the 19 studies aimed to change sexual risk behavior and 3 studies reported a significant reduction in a specific aspect of sexual risk behavior. Two of the interventions that led to behavioral change were peer-led and the other was teacher-led. Only 1 of the 8 randomized controlled trials reported any statistically significant change in sexual behavior, and then only for young females. CONCLUSION: The young people studied were more accepting of peer-led than teacher-led interventions. Peer-led interventions were also more successful in improving sexual knowledge, though there was no clear difference in their effectiveness in changing behavior. The improvement in sexual health knowledge does not necessarily lead to behavioral change.

"Behavioral interventions to reduce incidence of HIV, STD, and pregnancy among adolescents: A decade in review","Robin, L.; Dittus, P.; Whitaker, D.; Crosby, R.; Ethier, K.; Mezoff, J.; Miller, K.; Pappas-Deluca, K.","Purpose: To review adolescent sexual risk-reduction programs that were evaluated using quasi-experimental or experimental methods and published in the 1990s. We describe evaluated programs and identify program and evaluation issues for health educators and researchers. Methods: We systematically searched seven electronic databases and hand-searched journals to identify evaluations of behavioral interventions to reduce sexual risk behaviors among adolescents. Articles were included if they were published in the 1990s, provided a theoretical basis for the program, information about the interventions, clear aims, and quasi-experimental or experimental evaluation methods. We identified 101 articles, and 24 met our criteria for inclusion. Results: We reviewed these evaluations to assess their research and program characteristics. The majority of studies included randomized controlled designs and employed delayed follow-up measures. The most commonly measured outcomes were delay of initiation of sexual intercourse, condom use, contraceptive use, and frequency of sexual intercourse. Programs ranged from 1 to 80 sessions, most had adult facilitators, and commonly included skills-building activities about sexual communication, decision-making, and problem solving. The programs included a wide range of strategies for content delivery such as arts and crafts, school councils, and community service learning. Conclusions: Analysis of these programs suggest four overall factors that may impact program effectiveness including the extent to which programs focus on specific skills for reducing sexual risk behaviors; program duration and intensity; what constitutes the content of a total evaluated program including researchers' assumptions of participants' exposure to prior and concurrent programs; and what kind of training is available for facilitators.",2004,January,Journal of Adolescent Health,34,1,Mar-26,38050153,10.1016/S1054-139x(03)00244-1,,#59,Robin 2004,,

The impact of schools and school programs upon adolescent sexual behavior,"Kirby, D.","Because most youth are enrolled in school for many years before they initiate sex and when they initiate sex, schools have the potential for reducing adolescent sexual risk-taking. This paper reviews studies which examine the impact upon sexual risk-taking of school involvement, school characteristics, specific programs in school that do not address sexual behavior, and specific programs that do address sexual risk-taking. Multiple studies support several conclusions. First, involvement in and attachment to school and plans to attend higher education are all related to less sexual risk-taking and lower pregnancy rates. Second, students in schools with manifestations of poverty and disorganization are more likely to become pregnant. Third, some school programs specifically designed to increase attachment to school or reduce school dropout effectively delayed sex or reduced pregnancy rate, even when they did not address sexuality. Fourth, sex and HIV education programs do not increase sexual behavior, and some programs decrease sexual activity and increase condom or contraceptive use. Fifth, school-based clinics and school condom-availability programs do not increase sexual activity, and either may or may not increase condom or contraceptive use. Other studies reveal that there is very broad support for comprehensive sex- and HIV-education programs, and accordingly, most youth receive some amount of sex or HIV education. However, important topics are not covered in many schools.",2002,Feb,Journal of Sex Research,39,1,27-33,12476253,10.1080/00224490209552116,,#326,Kirby 2002,,

Intrauterine Contraception Continuation in Adolescents and Young Women: A Systematic Review,"Usinger, K. M.; Gola, S. B.; Weis, M.; Smaldone, A.","Study Objective Adolescents are at high risk for unintended pregnancies. Although intrauterine devices (IUDs), long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), are known to be highly effective in preventing pregnancy, little is known about IUD adherence in adolescents. In this systematic review (SR) we examined IUD continuation rates compared with other forms of contraception in young women aged 25 years and younger. Design, Setting, Participants, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measures A systematic search of Ovid Medline, Cochrane Library, and Embase was conducted for the years 1946-2015. Included studies examined IUD use in women 25 years of age and younger, compared IUD use with another form of contraception, and measured continuation rates at 12 months. The quality of each study was appraised using the Downs and Black criteria, and 12-month continuation rates among studies were pooled and analyzed according to contraceptive type. Results Of 3597 articles retrieved, 9 studies met criteria for SR. Synthesized across studies, 12-month continuation was significantly higher for IUD users (86.5%, 12,761/14,747) compared with oral contraceptives (39.6%, 1931/4873), Depo-Provera (Pfizer Inc, New York, NY) hormonal injection (39.8%, 510/1282), vaginal ring (48.9%, 196/401), and transdermal patch (39.8%, 37/93; all P values < .001). There was no statistically significant difference in 12-month continuation between the IUD and another LARC method, the subdermal etonogestrel implant (85.3%, 4671/5474). Conclusion Findings of this SR suggest that continuation rates for IUDs are generally higher compared with other contraceptive methods for women aged 25 years and younger. In a population with high rates of unintended pregnancies, generally low adherence, and imperfect use with other non-LARCs, IUD use should be encouraged. © 2016 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology",2016,,Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology,29,6,659-667,,10.1016/j.jpag.2016.06.007,,#265,Usinger 2016,,
The effectiveness of social marketing in reduction of teenage pregnancies: a review of studies in developed countries (Structured abstract),"Wakhisi, As; Allotey, P; Dhillon, N; Reidpath, Dd","The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a social marketing approach in reduction of unintended teenage pregnancies. We identified studies undertaken between 1990 and 2008 through electronic searches of databases, manual searches of bibliographies, and consultations with experts. Twelve studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected for further analysis. Results showed variation in intervention effects across specified outcomes (reduction in unintended pregnancies, delayed sexual initiation, contraceptive use at last intercourse, knowledge of contraception and reproductive health, and self-efficacy to refuse unwanted sex). Of the 12 studies, 9 reported significant effects on at least one of the outcomes. Long-term interventions were generally more effective than short-term ones for most outcomes. The impact on male participants' sexual behavior was minimal in most studies. Overall, social marketing appears to be an effective approach in reducing teenage pregnancies and influencing sexual behavior change, but the evidence is limited to particular outcomes and context. There is, therefore, need for more primary studies specifically designed around social marketing principles for more robust evaluations. The minimal impact on male participants' behavior also warrants further investigation.",2011,,Social Marketing Quarterly,17,1,56-90,DARE-12011005951,10.1080/15245004.2010.546941,,#263,Wakhisi 2011,,
"Intervention now to eliminate repeat unintended pregnancy in teenagers (INTERUPT): A systematic review of intervention effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and qualitative and realist synthesis of implementation factors and user engagement","Whitaker, R.; Hendry, M.; Aslam, R.; Booth, A.; Carter, B.; Charles, J. M.; Craine, N.; Edwards, R. T.; Noyes, J.; Ntambwe, L. I.; Pasterfield, D.; Rycroft-Malone, J.; Williams, N.","Background: The UK has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancies in Western Europe. One-fifth of these are repeat pregnancies. Unintended conceptions can cause substantial emotional, psychological and educational harm to teenagers, often with enduring implications for life chances. Babies of teenage mothers have increased mortality and are at a significantly increased risk of poverty, educational underachievement and unemployment later in life, with associated costs to society. It is important to identify effective, cost-effective and acceptable interventions. Objectives: To identify who is at the greatest risk of repeat unintended pregnancies; which interventions are effective and cost-effective; and what the barriers to and facilitators of the uptake of these interventions are. Data sources: We conducted a multistreamed, mixed-methods systematic review informed by service user and provider consultation to examine worldwide peer-reviewed evidence and UK-generated grey literature to find and evaluate interventions to reduce repeat unintended teenage pregnancies. We searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, The Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and the Health Technology Assessment Database), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database), British Nursing Index, Educational Resources Information Center, Sociological Abstracts, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, BiblioMap (the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre register of health promotion and public health research), Social Sciences Citation Index (supported by Web of Knowledge), Research Papers in Economics, EconLit (American Economic Association’s electronic bibliography), OpenGrey, Scopus, Scirus, Social Care Online, National Research Register, National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Network Portfolio and Index to THESES. Searches were conducted in May 2013 and updated in June 2014. In addition, we conducted a systematic search of Google (Google Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) in January 2014. Database searches were guided by an advisory group of stakeholders. Review methods: To address the topic’s complexities, we used a structured, innovative and iterative approach combining methods tailored to each evidence stream. Quantitative data (effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, risk factors and effect modifiers) were synthesised with reference to Cochrane guidelines for evaluating evidence on public health interventions. Qualitative evidence addressing facilitators of and barriers to the uptake of interventions, experience and acceptability of interventions was synthesised thematically. We applied the principles of realist synthesis to uncover theories and mechanisms underpinning interventions (what works, for whom and in what context). Finally, we conducted an overarching narrative of synthesis of evidence and gathered service user feedback. Results: We identified 8664 documents initially, and 816 in repeat searches. We filtered these to 12 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), four quasi-RCTs, 10 qualitative studies and 53 other quantitative studies published between 1996 and 2012. None of the RCTs was based in the UK. The RCTs evaluated an emergency contraception programme and psychosocial interventions. We found no evidence for effectiveness with regard to condom use, contraceptive use or rates of unprotected sex or use of birth control. Our primary outcome was repeat conception rate: the event rate was 132 of 308 (43%) in the intervention group versus 140 of 289 (48%) for the control goup, with a non-significant risk ratio (RR) of 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.08]. Four studies reported subsequent birth rates: 29 of 237 (12%) events for the intervention arm versus 46 out of 224 (21%) for the control arm, with a RR of 0.60 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.93). Many repeat conceptions occurred in the context of pov rty, low expectations and aspirations, and negligible opportunities. Service user feedback suggested that there were specific motivations for many repeat conceptions, for example to replace loss or to please a partner. Realist synthesis highlighted that context, motivation, planning for the future and letting young women take control with connectedness and tailoring provide a conceptual framework for future research. Limitations: Included studies rarely characterised adolescent pregnancy as intended or unintended, that is interventions to reduce repeat conceptions rarely addressed whether or not pregnancies were intended. Furthermore, interventions were often not clearly defined, had multiple aims and did not indicate which elements were intended to address which aims. Nearly all of the studies were conducted in the USA and focused largely on African American or Hispanic and Latina American populations. Conclusions: We found no evidence to indicate that existing interventions to reduce repeat teenage pregnancy were effective; however, subsequent births were reduced by home-based interventions. Qualitative and realist evidence helped to explain gaps in intervention design that should be addressed. More theory-based, rigorously evaluated programmes need to be developed to reduce repeat teenage pregnancy in the UK. © Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016.",2016,,Health Technology Assessment,20,16,1-214,,10.3310/hta20160,,#257,Whitaker 2016,,
Technology-Based Interventions to Reduce Sexually Transmitted Infections and Unintended Pregnancy Among Youth,"Widman, L.; Nesi, J.; Kamke, K.; Choukas-Bradley, S.; Stewart, J. L.","Purpose: Technology-based interventions to promote sexual health have proliferated in recent years, yet their efficacy among youth has not been meta-analyzed. This study synthesizes the literature on technology-based sexual health interventions among youth. Methods: Studies were included if they (1) sampled youth ages 13–24; (2) utilized technology-based platforms; (3) measured condom use or abstinence as outcomes; (4) evaluated program effects with experimental or quasi-experimental designs; and (5) were published in English. Results: Sixteen studies with 11,525 youth were synthesized. There was a significant weighted mean effect of technology-based interventions on condom use (d =.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] [.12,.34], p <.001) and abstinence (d =.21, 95% CI [.02,.40], p =.027). Effects did not differ by age, gender, country, intervention dose, interactivity, or program tailoring. However, effects were stronger when assessed with short-term (1–5 months) than with longer term (greater than 6 months) follow-ups. Compared with control programs, technology-based interventions were also more effective in increasing sexual health knowledge (d =.40, p <.001) and safer sex norms (d =.15, p =.022) and attitudes (d =.12, p =.016). Conclusions: After 15 years of research on youth-focused technology-based interventions, this meta-analysis demonstrates their promise to improve safer sex behavior and cognitions. Future work should adapt interventions to extend their protective effects over time. © 2018 The Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine",2018,,Journal of Adolescent Health,62,6,651-660,,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2018.02.007,,#255,Widman 2018,,
Motivational interviews to improve contraceptive use in populations at high risk of unintended pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Wilson, A.; Nirantharakumar, K.; Truchanowicz, E. G.; Surenthirakumaran, R.; Macarthur, C.; Coomarasamy, A.","Objective Effective contraceptive use has the potential to prevent around 230 million births each year. An estimated 222 million women want to delay pregnancy or cease childbearing, but are not actively using contraception. Lack of education is a known barrier for effective contraceptive use. Motivational interviews are presumed to improve effective contraceptive use, but studies to date report varied findings. Some studies demonstrate an improvement and others report no effect. Study design A systematic review of evidence on the impact of motivational interviews on contraceptive use in women of childbearing age was carried out using MEDLINE, EMBASE, BNI, Cochrane library, CINHAL, African Index Medicus, Web of Science, the Reproductive Health Library, and the Science Citation Index (inception-January 2013) without language restriction. Search terms included 'motivational interview∗AND contraception OR family planning OR maternal OR pregnancy'. Randomised controlled trials comparing the effect of motivational interviews with standard practice on effective contraception use in women of reproductive age were included. The outcome measures were use of effective contraception or use of high-level contraception, and subsequent births or pregnancies. The random effects model was used to pool the risk ratios from individual studies. Results Eight randomised controlled trials were included in the review with a total of 3424 women at high risk of pregnancy. Meta-analysis showed an increase in effective contraceptive use with motivational interviews when compared with control (RR 1.32 95%CI 1.11, 1.56: P = 0.002) in the period of zero to four months post intervention. No difference in effective contraceptive use was shown at four to eight months (RR 1.10, 95%CI 0.93, 1.32: P = 0.27), and between eight to twelve months (RR 1.18 95%CI 0.96, 1.46: P = 0.12). No evidence of effect in the reduction of subsequent pregnancies or births at twelve to twenty-four months was seen with motivational interviews (RR 0.80 95%CI 0.51, 1.26: P = 0.34). Conclusion Motivational interviews significantly increase effective contraceptive use immediately after and up to four months post-intervention. The effect without reinforcement is short lasting as no evidence of effect is seen after four months post-intervention. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Interventions using new digital media to improve adolescent sexual health: A systematic review,"Guse, K.; Levine, D.; Martins, S.; Lira, A.; Gaarde, J.; Westmorland, W.; Gilliam, M.","New digital media (e.g., the Internet, text messaging, and social networking sites [SNS]) have dramatically altered the communication landscape, especially for youth. These communication platforms present new tools for engaging youth in sexual health promotion and risk reduction. We searched eight public databases across multiple disciplines for all peer-reviewed studies published between January 2000 and May 2011 that empirically evaluated the impact of digital media-based interventions on the sexual health knowledge, attitudes, and/or behaviors of adolescents aged 13-24 years. Of 942 abstracts, 10 met inclusion criteria. Seven studies were conducted in the United States. Eight described Web-based interventions, one used mobile phones, and one was conducted on an SNS. Two studies significantly delayed initiation of sex, and one was successful in encouraging users of an SNS to remove sex references from their public profile. Seven interventions significantly influenced psychosocial outcomes such as condom self-efficacy and abstinence attitudes, but at times the results were in directions unexpected by the study authors. Six studies increased knowledge of HIV, sexually transmitted infections, or pregnancy. This area of research is emerging and rapidly changing. More data from controlled studies with longer (>1 year) follow-up and measurement of behavioral outcomes will provide a more robust evidence base from which to judge the effectiveness of new digital media in changing adolescent sexual behavior. © 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.",2012,,Journal of Adolescent Health,51,6,535-543,,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2012.03.014,,#172,Guse 2012,,
Sexuality education and young people's sexual behavior: a review of studies,"Grunseit, A.; Kippax, S.; Aggleton, P.; Baldo, M.; Slutkin, G.","Sexuality education for children and young adults is one of the most heavily debated issues facing policy-makers, national AIDS program planners, and educators, provoking arguments over how explicit education materials should be, how much of it there should be, how often it should be given, and at what age instruction should commence. In this context, the World Health Organization's Global Program on AIDS' Office of Intervention Development and Support commissioned a comprehensive literature review to assess the effects of HIV/AIDS and sexuality education upon young people's sexual behavior. 52 reports culled from a search of 12 literature databases were reviewed. The main purpose of the review is to inform policy-makers, program planners, and educators about the impact of HIV and/or sexuality education upon the sexual behavior of youth as described in the published literature. Of 47 studies which evaluated interventions, 25 reported that HIV/AIDS and sexuality education neither increased nor decreased sexual activity and attendant rates of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). 17 reported that HIV and/or sexuality education delayed the onset of sexual activity, reduced the number of sex partners, or reduced unplanned pregnancy and STD rates Only 3 studies found increases in sexual behavior associated with sexuality education.

Abstinence-based programs for prevention of adolescent pregnancies: A review,"Thomas, M. H.","This article assesses the abstinence-based programs developed by family life educators and the factors associated with positive results through a review of abstinence promotion programs of the federal government. In 1996, Section 510 was added to Title V of the Social Security Act allocating US$50 million annually from 1998-2000 to fund abstinence education programs, while in 1997, a National Strategy to Prevent Teen Pregnancy was launched by the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention to provide teen pregnancy programs to at least 25% of the communities. Presented in this paper is a discussion of the Abstinence Only programs, which focus on the prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease among adolescents, and the Abstinence Plus programs, which emphasize other prevention methods as well as abstinence. Evaluation of Abstinence Only programs include Success Express, Project Taking Charge, Sex Respect, Teen Aid, Values and Choices and Facts and Feelings. Moreover, programs such as Reducing the Risk, Postponing Sexual Involvement, Project Education Now, and Babies Later were evaluated under the Abstinence Plus programs. Several programs evaluated have shown to have a positive effect on attitudes among adolescents, but are not proven to have a significant effect on sexual behavior. In conclusion, this article encourages exploration of new approaches to address teen pregnancy and the increasing incidence of sexually transmitted diseases among adolescents, while the federal government must utilize the implementation of existing programs with positive effects.eng",2000,January,Journal of Adolescent Health,26,1,May-17,30003972,,,#12,Thomas 2000,,
Early fatherhood: a mapping of the evidence base relating to pregnancy prevention and parenting support,"Trivedi, D.; Brooks, F.; Bunn, F.; Graham, M.","Teenage pregnancy prevention programmes targeted at young women have received considerable attention from researchers and programme developers. However, to date, relatively limited information is available on preventing teenage fatherhood or improving outcomes for young fathers. A notable gap is concerned with understanding the forms of sexual health programmes that are most effective from the perspective of young men. We conducted a systematic mapping to identify studies involving young men aimed at preventing teenage pregnancy, improving outcomes for teenage fathers or exploring the perspectives of young men around pregnancy and fatherhood. We searched a wide range of electronic databases from January 1996 to August 2008. Three quantitative and 15 qualitative studies were identified, of which nine were UK based. Key themes related to the inappropriateness of current sexual health promotion to respond to the needs of young men. While young men often possessed very similar ideals to young women, existing programmes were problematic when they negatively stereotyped young men and ineffectively addressed models of masculinity or the difficulties young men may have forming meaningful relationships. Further investigations are required on programme development for young men, particularly on sexual health promotion interventions for 'looked-after' young men and those from unstable childhoods.",2009,Dec,Health Education Research,24,6,999-1028,19407211,10.1093/her/cyp025,,#8,Trivedi 2009,,

Results were analyzed in a narrative systematic review, taking account of methodological quality.ResultsWe identified adequately robust evaluations of 44 programs, delivered in diverse settings. In nearly all cases, the parenting component focused on improving parent–child communication about sex. In general, where measured, parent–child interaction and adolescents' knowledge and attitudes improved, but sexual behavior outcomes only improved in approximately half the studies. Three programs in which the parenting component made up at least one-fourth of the overall program were found, through randomized controlled trials, to modify some aspect of adolescents' sexual behavior. All programs involved parents for at least 14 hours, were community-based, and encouraged delayed sex.ConclusionsTargeted programs with intensive parental involvement can modify adolescents' sexual behavior, although the review was limited by the lack of rigorous evaluations.

"Programs to reduce teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and associated sexual risk behaviors: A systematic review","Goesling, B.; Colman, S.; Trenholm, C.; Terzian, M.; Moore, K.","Purpose: This systematic review provides a comprehensive, updated assessment of programs with evidence of effectiveness in reducing teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), or associated sexual risk behaviors. Methods: The review was conducted in four steps. First, multiple literature search strategies were used to identify relevant studies released from 1989 through January 2011. Second, identified studies were screened against prespecified eligibility criteria. Third, studies were assessed by teams of two trained reviewers for the quality and execution of their research designs. Fourth, for studies that passed the quality assessment, the review team extracted and analyzed information on the research design, study sample, evaluation setting, and program impacts. Results: A total of 88 studies met the review criteria for study quality and were included in the data extraction and analysis. The studies examined a range of programs delivered in diverse settings. Most studies had mixed-gender and predominately African-American research samples (70% and 51%, respectively). Randomized controlled trials accounted for the large majority (87%) of included studies. Most studies (76%) included multiple follow-ups, with sample sizes ranging from 62 to 5,244. Analysis of the study impact findings identified 31 programs with evidence of effectiveness. Conclusions: Research conducted since the late 1980s has identified more than two dozen teen pregnancy and STI prevention programs with evidence of effectiveness. Key strengths of this research are the large number of randomized controlled trials, the common use of multiple follow-up periods, and attention to a broad range of programs delivered in diverse settings. Two main gaps are a lack of replication studies and the need for more research on Latino youth and other high-risk populations. In addressing these gaps, researchers must overcome common limitations in study design, analysis, and reporting that have negatively affected prior research. © 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

The health and welfare effects of day-care: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials,"Zoritch, B.; Roberts, I.; Oakley, A.","Day-care has long been a controversial aspect of social policy in countries such as the U.K. What evidence is there about the effects of out-of-home day-care on educational, health and welfare outcomes for children and their families? This paper applies to day-care studies, the methodology of the systematic review as pioneered in the health care field, in order to establish the evidence-base for day-care provision. Randomised controlled trials of day-care for pre-school children were identified using electronic databases, hand searches of relevant literature and contacts with authors. A total of 8 trials were identified after examining 920 abstracts and 19 books. All the trials were carried out in the U.S.A. European research on this topic is extensive but we did not identify any studies using trial design. Instead observational, case controlled and cohort studies were prominent. The trials were assessed for methodological quality. Results showed that day-care promotes children's intelligence, development and school achievement. Long-term follow up demonstrates increased employment, lower teenage pregnancy rates, higher socio-economic status and decreased criminal behaviour. There are positive effects on mothers' education, employment and interaction with children. Effects on fathers have not been examined. Few studies look at a range of outcomes spanning the health, education and welfare domains. Most of the trials combined non-parental day-care with some element of parent training or education (mostly targeted at mothers); they did not disentangle the possible effects of these two interventions. The trials had other significant methodological weaknesses, pointing to the importance of improving on study design in this field.

Jennifer; Camenga, Deepa R.; Fiellin, Lynn E.","Little research has been done on the efficacy of electronic media–based interventions, especially on their effect on health or safety behavior. The current review systematically identified and evaluated electronic media–based interventions that focused on promoting health and safety behavior change in youth.To assess the type and quality of the studies evaluating the effects of electronic media–based interventions on health and safety behavior change.Studies were identified from searches in MEDLINE (1950 through September 2010) and PsycINFO (1967 through September 2010). The review included published studies of interventions that used electronic media and focused on changes in behavior related to health or safety in children aged 18 years or younger.Nineteen studies met the criteria and focused on at least 1 behavior change outcome. The focus was interventions related to physical activity and/or nutrition in 7 studies, on asthma in 6, safety behaviors in 3, sexual risk behaviors in 2, and diabetes mellitus in 1. Seventeen studies reported at least 1 statistically significant effect on behavior change outcomes, including an increase in fruit, juice, or vegetable consumption; an increase in physical activity; improved asthma self-management; acquisition of street and fire safety skills; and sexual abstinence.

Emergency contraception. Widely available and effective but disappointing as a public health intervention: a review,Eshre CapriWorkshop Group,"Emergency contraception (EC) prevents pregnancy after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. Use of EC has increased markedly in countries where a product is available over the counter, yet barriers to availability and use remain. Although effective in clinical trials, it has not yet been possible to show a public health benefit of EC in terms of reduction of unintended pregnancy rates. Selective progesterone receptor modulators developed as emergency contraceptives offer better effectiveness than levonorgestrel, but still EC is less effective than use of ongoing regular contraception.

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Interventions for Sexual Health Promotion Involving Serious Digital Games,"DeSmet, A.; Shegog, R.; Van Ryckeghem, D.; Crombez, G.; De Bourdeaudhuij, I.","OBJECTIVE: Serious games may be effective in promoting sexual health behavior. Their confidential nature may encourage users to discuss sensitive sexuality topics. Furthermore, they can tailor messages to the individual's needs and may be intrinsically motivating. This meta-analysis investigates the effectiveness of interventions for sexual health promotion that use serious games. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A database search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO for publications before the end of July 2013. Serious digital games studies measuring effects on behavior or its determinants, using a control condition, allowing the calculation of an effect size (Hedges' g, random-effects model) were included. RESULTS: Seven game studies for sexual health promotion were included. These showed positive effects on determinants (g=0.242; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.129, 0.356), albeit of small effect size. The effects on behavior, measured in only two studies, were not significant (g=0.456; 95 percent confidence interval, -0.649, 1.561). Most games did not use many game features that are considered to be immersive or enhancing flow. Instead, there was a strong reliance on pure gamification features, such as rewards and feedback. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of the next generation of games may be enhanced by building on the behavioral change and educational gaming literatures (e.g., using role-play and simulation game formats, individual tailoring, offering adaptation in the difficulty of the challenge, and amount and timing of the feedback). There is a need for studies with rigorous evaluations of game effectiveness, longer-term follow-up, and using measures of behavior rather than merely their determinants.",2015,01-Apr,Games for health journal,4,2,78-90,616761303,10.1089/g4h.2014.0110,,#205,DeSmet 2015,,
Some (But Not Much) Progress Toward Understanding Teenage Childbearing. A Review of Research from the Past Decade,"Coyne, C. A.; D'Onofrio, B. M.","In the decade and a half since Coley and Chase-Lansdale's (1998) review of teenage childbearing, there have been a number of studies investigating teenage childbearing from a developmental psychological perspective. Many of these studies have focused primarily on identifying individual, familial, and socioeconomic risk factors in childhood and adolescence that are highly correlated with teenage sexual behavior and teenage childbearing. We have an emerging understanding of teenage childbearing as the culmination of a complex cascade of experiences and decisions that overlap greatly with the risks for antisocial behavior. Much of this research, however, is limited by its reliance on correlational and cross-sectional research designs, which are not able to rigorously test causal inferences or to identify mechanisms associated with teenage childbearing. Innovative studies using large, nationally representative samples with quasi-experimental and longitudinal designs can expand on such descriptive studies. In particular, quasi-experimental studies can help answer questions about which risk factors are causally associated with teenage childbearing and suggest potential mechanisms that can explain how teenage childbearing is associated with poor outcomes. Future studies also will need to incorporate more precise measures of developmental processes and explore heterogeneity among adolescent mothers. Although advances have been made in the psychological study of teenage childbearing, more research is needed in order to answer important questions about which psychological processes are causally related to teenage childbearing and how teenage childbearing is associated with poor outcomes for young mothers and their offspring. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",2012,,Advances in Child Development and Behavior,42,,113-152,364592036,,,#217,Coyne 2012,,
A Review of Positive Youth Development Programs That Promote Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health,"Gavin, Loretta E.; Catalano, Richard F.; David-Ferdon, Corinne; Gloppen, Kari M.; Markham, Christine M.","PurposePositive youth development (PYD) may be a promising strategy for promoting adolescent health. A systematic review of the published data was conducted to identify and describe PYD programs that improve adolescent sexual and reproductive health.MethodsEight databases were searched for articles about PYD programs published between 1985 and 2007. Programs included met the following criteria: fostered at least one of 12 PYD goals in multiple socialization domains (i.e., family, school, community) or addressed two or more goals in at least one socialization domain; allocated at least half of the program activities to promoting general PYD outcomes (as compared with a focus on direct sexual health content); included youth younger than 20 years old; and used an experimental or quasi-experimental evaluation design.ResultsThirty programs met the inclusion criteria, 15 of which had evidence of improving at least one adolescent sexual and reproductive health outcome. Program effects were moderate and well-sustained. Program goals addressed by approximately 50% or more of the effective programs included promoting prosocial bonding, cognitive competence, social competence, emotional competence, belief in the future, and self-determination. Effective programs were significantly more likely than those that did not have an impact to strengthen the school context and to deliver activities in a supportive atmosphere. Effective programs were also more likely to build skills, enhance bonding, strengthen the family, engage youth in real roles and activities, empower youth, communicate expectations, and be stable and relatively long-lasting, although these differences between effective and ineffective programs were not statistically significant.ConclusionPYD programs can promote adolescent sexual and reproductive health, and tested, effective PYD programs should be part of a comprehensive approach to promoting adolescent health.

Programs to Strengthen Parent-Adolescent Communication about Reproductive Health: A Systematic Review,"Gavin, L. E.; Williams, J. R.; Rivera, M. I.; Lachance, C. R.","Context When caring for an adolescent client, providers of contraceptive services must consider whether and how to encourage parent/guardian-child communication about the adolescent's reproductive health. The objective of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence on the effectiveness of programs designed to increase parent-child communication about reproductive health. The review was used to inform national recommendations on quality family planning services. Data analysis occurred from mid-2011 through 2012. Evidence acquisition Several electronic bibliographic databases were used to identify relevant articles, including PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Popline, published from January 1985 through February 2011. Evidence synthesis Sixteen articles met the inclusion criteria: all studies examined the impact on at least one medium- or short-term outcome, and two studies assessed the impact on teen pregnancy. One study examined the impact of a program conducted in a clinic setting; the remainder examined the impact of programs in community settings. All studies showed a positive impact on at least one short-term outcome, and 12 of 16 studies showed an increase in parent-child communication about reproductive health. Four of seven studies found an impact on sexual risk behavior. Conclusions Most programs increased parent-child communication, and several resulted in reduced sexual risk behavior of adolescents. This suggests that delivering a clinic-based program that effectively helps parents/guardians talk to their adolescent child(ren) about reproductive health, or referring parents/guardians to an evidence-based program in the community, may be beneficial. However, further rigorous research on delivery of these programs in clinical settings is needed. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",2015,,American Journal of Preventive Medicine,49,2,S65-S72,,10.1016/j.amepre.2015.03.022,,#187,Gavin 2015,,
Recent evaluations of the peer-led approach in adolescent sexual health education: a systematic review.,"Kim, Caron R; Free, Caroline","CONTEXT: Peer-led interventions have become a popular method of providing sexual health education to adolescents, but the efficacy of this approach and the methodological quality of recent trials have not been systematically reviewed. METHODS: Electronic and hand searches were conducted to identify quasi-randomized and randomized controlled trials of peer-led adolescent sexual health education published from 1998 to 2005. Studies were eligible if they had an appropriate comparison group, provided preintervention and postintervention data, and reported all outcomes. Study results were summarized and, where appropriate, pooled; in addition, 10 aspects of studies' methodological quality were assessed. RESULTS: Thirteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Pooled, adjusted results from seven trials that examined the effects of peer-led interventions on condom use at last sex found no overall benefit (odds ratio, 1.0). None of the three trials that assessed consistent condom use found a benefit. One study reported a reduced risk of chlamydia (0.2), but another found no impact on STD incidence. One study found that young women (but not young men) who received peer-led education were more likely than nonrecipients to have never had sex. Most interventions produced improvements in knowledge, attitudes and intentions. Only three studies fulfilled all 10 of the assessed quality criteria; two others met nine criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Despite promising results in some trials, overall findings do not provide convincing evidence that peer-led education improves sexual outcomes among adolescents. Future trials should build on the successful trials conducted to date and should strive to fulfill existing quality criteria.",2008,//,Perspectives on sexual and reproductive health,40,3,144-151,,,lshtm6996,#345,Kim 2008,,
Interventions addressing the social determinants of teenage pregnancy,"Fletcher, A.; Harden, A.; Brunton, G.; Oakley, A.; Bonell, C.","Purpose - The limited evidence of effectiveness of existing teenage pregnancy strategies which focus on sex education, together with growing evidence that factors such as poor school ethos, disaffection, truancy, poor employment prospects and low expectations are associated with teenage pregnancy, has increased interest in interventions which target these ""wider"" social determinants. This paper aims to identify promising interventions and priorities for future research and to make recommendations for policy and practice in the UK. Design/methodology/approach - This paper discusses the evidence regarding the potential of interventions which target determinants of teenage pregnancy relating to school disaffection and low expectations, drawing on recent systematic reviews and trials to consider future directions for research, policy and practice. Findings - High-quality research evidence illustrates the potential of two approaches to address determinants of teenage pregnancy relating to disaffection and low expectations. These are school-ethos interventions, which aim to facilitate a positive and inclusive school-ethos, strengthen school relationships and reduce disaffection; and targeted, intensive youth work interventions, which aim to promote positive expectations, vocational readiness and self-esteem through vocational and life-skills education, volunteering and work experience. Practical implications - Two forms of intervention which address key social determinants of teenage pregnancy - school-ethos interventions and targeted youth work interventions - require more attention from researchers and policy-makers. Originality/value - This paper calls for a shift in the research and policy agenda. In addition to interventions that aim to address proximal, individual factors, such as sexual health-related knowledge, there should be a more complementary focus on socio-environmental as well as targeted individual-focused interventions aiming to address the wider social determinants of teenage pregnancy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",2008,,Health Education,108,1,29-39,,10.1108/09654280810842111,,#269,Fletcher 2008,,

In total, 12 108 references were identified, of which 440 were retrieved and screened. Overall, 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. Findings showed that parent-based interventions were inconsistently effective at reducing young people’s sexual risk behaviours. Parent-based interventions had greater impact on parent/child communication than family-based interventions, which showed no evidence of effectiveness. However, increasing parent/child communication showed no effect on sexual risk behaviours. Preliminary evidence suggests that effectiveness was greater in those studies aiming to affect multiple risk behaviours. However, this may be due to longer programme delivery and follow-up times; further evidence is required. Sexual health communication was sensitive to intervention. Studies addressing multiple risk behaviours may be as effective as targeted interventions at affecting sexual risk behaviours.

Preconception care: Promoting reproductive planning,"Dean, S. V.; Lassi, Z. S.; Imam, A. M.; Bhutta, Z. A.","Introduction. Preconception care recognizes that many adolescent girls and young women will be thrust into motherhood without the knowledge, skills or support they need. Sixty million adolescents give birth each year worldwide, even though pregnancy in adolescence has mortality rates at least twice as high as pregnancy in women aged 20-29 years. Reproductive planning and contraceptive use can prevent unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions and sexually-transmitted infections in adolescent girls and women. Smaller families also mean better nutrition and development opportunities, yet 222 million couples continue to lack access to modern contraception. Results: Comprehensive interventions can prevent first pregnancy in adolescence by 15% and repeat adolescent pregnancy by 37%. Such interventions should address underlying social and community factors, include sexual and reproductive health services, contraceptive provision; personal development programs and emphasizes completion of education. Appropriate birth spacing (18-24 months from birth to next pregnancy compared to short intervals <6 months) can significantly lower maternal mortality, preterm births, stillbirths, low birth weight and early neonatal deaths. Method. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence was conducted to ascertain the possible impact of preconception care for adolescents, women and couples of reproductive age on MNCH outcomes. A comprehensive strategy was used to search electronic reference libraries, and both observational and clinical controlled trials were included. Cross-referencing and a separate search strategy for each preconception risk and intervention ensured wider study capture. Conclusion: Improving adolescent health and preventing adolescent pregnancy; and promotion of birth spacing through increasing correct and consistent use of effective contraception are fundamental to preconception care. Promoting reproductive planning on a wider scale is closely interlinked with the reliable provision of effective contraception, however, innovative strategies will need to be devised, or existing strategies such as community-based health workers and peer educators may be expanded, to encourage girls and women to plan their families. © 2014Dean et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2014,,Reproductive Health,11,,,,10.1186/1742-4755-11-S3-S2,,#208,Dean 2014,Meigan Thomson (2020-04-01 23:43:36)(Screen): age group too old - 20-29 year olds; ,

Data from studies meeting inclusion criteria were qualitatively analyzed.ResultsTwenty studies met inclusion criteria, including 10 containing comparative data (e.g., before and after study or control study design). The studies generally demonstrated positive impact, although results varied across settings and approaches. The most successful approaches included mail-based chlamydia screening in the Netherlands, condom distribution via street outreach in Louisiana, home-based HIV counseling and testing in Malawi, and promotion of over-the-counter access to emergency contraception in various countries.ConclusionOverall, this review suggests that out-of-facility approaches can be important avenues to reach youth.

A systematic review of the effectiveness of adolescent pregnancy primary prevention programs,"DiCenso, A; Guyatt, G; Willan, A","IssueThe rate of teenage pregnancy in Canada is rising. Adolescent pregnancy is associatedwith physical, emotional and financial consequences.BackgroundIn 1994, the most recent year for which Statistics Canada figures are available, therewere 48.8 pregnancies per 1000 Canadian females aged 15 to 19. This translates into46,800 teen pregnancies, an increase of more than 20% since 1987. Pregnancy beforeage 20 is associated with a number of medical risks for both the mother and child, lossof educational and occupational opportunities, and diminished socioeconomic status.Public Health MandatePublic Health Units are responsible for reducing the rate of adolescent pregnancy. Oneof the target groups is school-aged children in Grades 7 to 9 who should receive threehours annually of sexual health education.What’s the Evidence· Some adolescent pregnancy prevention programs have been effective in delayinginitiation of intercourse, improving birth control use, and reducing pregnancies.However, the only studies available are of poorly designed evaluations.· Programs that focus on sexuality, including school, community and clinic-basedinterventions do not increase sexual activity.· No evidence was located to indicate that abstinence-only programs have delayed theonset of sexual intercourse or reduced pregnancies.· Programs that showed a positive impact were quite substantial in duration; focusedon behaviours; were theory-based; actively involved participants; shared facts;focused on social pressures, modeling and skill rehearsal; and, included trained adultor peer leaders.Implications· There is a crucial need for the careful design and evaluation of a multicomponentpregnancy prevention intervention for adolescents.

Evidence acquisition: Methods for conducting systematic reviews from the Guide to Community Preventive Services were used to synthesize scientific evidence on the effectiveness of two strategies for group-based behavioral interventions for adolescents: (1) comprehensive risk reduction and (2) abstinence education on preventing pregnancy, HIV, and other STIs. Effectiveness of these interventions was determined by reductions in sexual risk behaviors, pregnancy, HIV, and other STIs and increases in protective sexual behaviors. The literature search identified 6579 citations for comprehensive risk reduction and abstinence education. Of these, 66 studies of comprehensive risk reduction and 23 studies of abstinence education assessed the effects of group-based interventions that address the sexual behavior of adolescents, and were included in the respective reviews. Evidence synthesis: Meta-analyses were conducted for each strategy on the seven key outcomes identified by the coordination teamcurrent sexual activity; frequency of sexual activity; number of sex partners; frequency of unprotected sexual activity; use of protection (condoms and/or hormonal contraception); pregnancy; and STIs. The results of these meta-analyses for comprehensive risk reduction showed favorable effects for all of the outcomes reviewed. For abstinence education, the meta-analysis showed a small number of studies, with inconsistent findings across studies that varied by study design and follow-up time, leading to considerable uncertainty around effect estimates. Conclusions: Based on these findings, group-based comprehensive risk reduction was found to be an effective strategy to reduce adolescent pregnancy, HIV, and STIs.

Objectives We conducted a systematic review to explore opportunistic sexual and reproductive health services for sexual health communication delivered at primary health care level. Search strategy We searched for studies on PubMed, ProQuest, CINAHL, Jstor, Scopus/Science Direct, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, EBSCO, CINAHL, PsychoInfo, and Web of Knowledge. Both published and unpublished articles were reviewed. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials were included. Participants of all ages, from adolescence onwards were included. Brief (10-60 minutes) interventions including some aspect of communication on sexual health issues were included. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted by two reviewers independently using a standardised form. Interventions differed from each other, hence meta-analysis was not performed, and results are presented individually. Main results A total of 247 articles were selected for full-text evaluation, 31 of which were included. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)/HIV were less often reported in the intervention group compared with the control group. Condom use was higher in most studies in the intervention group. Numbers of sexual partners and unprotected sexual intercourse were lower in the intervention groups.

A comprehensive literature search of studies published from January 1988 through September 2007 yielded 21 relevant studies. Significant intervention effects were found for the following outcomes: condom use, condom acquisition/condom carrying, delayed sexual initiation among youth, and reduced incident STIs. The stratified analyses for condom use indicated that interventions were efficacious for various groups (e.g., youth, adults, males, commercial sex workers, clinic populations, and populations in areas with high STI incidence). Interventions increasing the availability of or accessibility to condoms or including additional individual, small-group or community-level components along with condom distribution were shown to be efficacious in increasing condom use behaviors.

Sexual Health Behavior Interventions for U.S. Latino Adolescents: A Systematic Review of the Literature,"Cardoza, V. J.; Documét, P. I.; Fryer, C. S.; Gold, M. A.; Butler, J.","Study Objective: To identify sexual health behavior interventions targeting U.S. Latino adolescents. Design: A systematic literature review. Setting: Peer-reviewed articles published between 1993 and 2011, conducted in any type of setting. Participants: Male and female Latino adolescents ages 11-21 years. Interventions: Interventions promoting sexual abstinence, pregnancy prevention, sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention, and/or HIV/AIDS prevention. Main Outcome Measures: Changes in knowledge, attitudes, engagement in risky sexual behaviors, rates of STIs, and/or pregnancy. Results: Sixty-eight articles were identified. Fifteen were included in this review that specifically addressed Latino adolescent sexual health behavior. Among the reviewed interventions, most aimed to prevent or reduce STI and HIV/AIDS incidence by focusing on behavior change at two levels of the social ecological model: individual and interpersonal. Major strengths of the articles included addressing the most critical issues of sexual health; using social ecological approaches; employing different strategies to deliver sexual health messages; and employing different intervention designs in diverse geographical locations with the largest population of Latino communities. Most of the interventions targeted female adolescents, stressing the need for additional interventions that target Latino adolescent males. Conclusions: Latino adolescent sexual health is a new research field with gaps that need to be addressed in reducing negative sexual health outcomes among this population. More research is needed to produce new or validate existing, age-specific, and culturally-sensitive sexual health interventions for Latino male and female adolescents. Further, this research should also be conducted in areas of the U.S. with the newest Latino migration (e.g., North Carolina). © 2012 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.",2012,,Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology,25,2,136-149,,10.1016/j.jpag.2011.09.011,,#236,Cardoza 2012,,
Youth-Friendly Family Planning Services for Young People: A Systematic Review,"Brittain, A. W.; Williams, J. R.; Zapata, L. B.; Pazol, K.; Romero, L. M.; Weik, T. S.","Context ""Youth-friendly"" family planning services, services tailored to meet the particular sexual and reproductive health needs of young people (aged 10-24 years), may improve reproductive health outcomes, including reduction of unintended pregnancy. The objectives of this systematic review were to summarize the evidence of the effect of youth-friendly family planning services on reproductive health outcomes and to describe key characteristics of youth-friendly family planning interventions. The review, conducted in 2011, was used to inform national recommendations on quality family planning services. Evidence acquisition Several electronic bibliographic databases, including PubMed, PsycINFO, and Popline, were used to identify relevant articles published from January 1985 through February 2011. Evidence synthesis Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Of these, six evaluated outcomes relevant to unintended pregnancy, contraceptive use, and knowledge or patient satisfaction. The 13 remaining studies identified perspectives on youth-friendly characteristics. Of the studies examining outcomes, most had a positive effect (two of three for unintended pregnancy, three of three for contraceptive use, and three of three for knowledge and/or patient satisfaction). Remaining studies described nine key characteristics of youth-friendly family planning services. Conclusions This review demonstrates that there is limited evidence that youth-friendly services may improve reproductive health outcomes for young people and identifies service characteristics that might increase their receptivity to using these services. Although more rigorous studies are needed, the interventions and characteristics identified in this review should be considered in the development and evaluation of youth-friendly family planning interventions in clinical settings. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",2015,,American Journal of Preventive Medicine,49,2,S73-S84,,10.1016/j.amepre.2015.03.019,,#243,Brittain 2015,,
Features of successful sexual health promotion programs for young people: findings from a review of systematic reviews,"Bowring, A. L.; Wright, C. J. C.; Douglass, C.; Gold, J.; Lim, M. S. C.","Issue addressed: Young people have a high burden of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) problems, and it is important to reach this group through health promotion initiatives. We conducted a systematic review of reviews to identify successful elements of health promotion programs for improving SRH of young people. Methods: We identified and collated systematic reviews published in 2005-2015 which focused on young people (10-24 years), reported on SRH outcomes (pregnancy, sexually transmissible infections, condoms/contraceptive use, risky sexual behaviour, sexual healthcare access or intimate partner violence), and included primary studies predominantly conducted in high-income countries. This report focuses on features of successful SRH programs identified in the interpretation and discussion of included systematic reviews. Results: We identified 66 systematic reviews, of which 37 reported on program features which were anecdotally or statistically associated with improved program effectiveness and success. Common features of effective interventions were: longer term or repeated implementation; multi-setting and multi-component; parental involvement; culturally/gender/age appropriate; and inclusion of skills-building. So what?: There is marked consistency of features improving SRH program effectiveness for young people despite the wide variation in interventions reviewed. There is a need to better implement this knowledge in future programs, and our findings provide useful guidance for optimising the design of SRH interventions for young people. © 2017 Australian Health Promotion Association",2018,,Health Promotion Journal of Australia,29,1,46-57,,10.1002/hpja.3,,#286,Bowring 2018,,

"Systematic review and narrative synthesis of the effectiveness of contraceptive service interventions for young people, delivered in health care settings","Blank, L.; Baxter, S. K.; Payne, N.; Guillaume, L. R.; Squires, H.","A systematic review and narrative synthesis to determine the effectiveness of contraception service interventions for young people delivered in health care premises was undertaken. We searched 12 key health and medical databases, reference lists of included papers and systematic reviews and cited reference searches on included articles. All retrieved literature was screened at title and abstract levels, and relevant articles were taken through to full paper appraisal. Data relating to study design, outcomes and quality were extracted by one reviewer and independently checked by a second reviewer. We included interventions that consisted of contraceptive service provision for young people, and also interventions to encourage young people to use existing contraceptive services. The searches identified 23 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The papers focused on: new adolescent services, outreach to existing services, advanced provision of emergency contraception, condom/contraceptive provision and advice and repeat pregnancy prevention. The literature in general is not well developed in terms of good quality effectiveness studies and key outcome measures. However, it is possible to make recommendations in terms of outreach versus targeted young people's services in health care settings, advanced provision of emergency contraception and long-acting reversible contraception to prevent repeat adolescent pregnancy. © 2012 The Author 2012.",2012,,Health Education Research,27,6,1102-1119,,10.1093/her/cys056,,#290,Blank 2012,,
"Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis of the Effectiveness of Contraceptive Service Interventions for Young People, Delivered in Educational Settings","Blank, L.; Baxter, S. K.; Payne, N.; Guillaume, L. R.; Pilgrim, H.","Study Objective: This review was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of contraception service interventions for young people that were delivered in educational settings. Design: We conducted a systematic review and narrative synthesis. Setting: Interventions were included where they were delivered in educational institutions, including schools, colleges, and pupil referral units. Participants: Young people aged 19 and under. Studies of wider age groups were included if the majority of participants were aged under 19 years. Interventions: We included interventions which consisted of contraceptive service provision, and also interventions to encourage young people to use existing contraceptive services. Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome measures used in the studies were: rate of teenage pregnancy, rate of contraceptive use, and sexual behavior. Many outcome measures were self reported. Results: Twenty-nine papers were included which reported on interventions to prevent adolescent pregnancy (and repeat pregnancy), school-based health centers, contraceptive use in college students, and multicomponent interventions. Intensive case management intervention conducted by a culturally matched school-based social worker (along with other components including peer education) were shown to be effective in preventing repeat adolescent pregnancy, at least for the duration of the intervention. Also, school-based health centers appear to be most effective when contraception provision is made available on site. Conclusions: The evidence from these papers is limited, in terms of both quality and quantity, along with consistency of findings, but some recommendations in relation to effective interventions can be made. © 2010 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology.",2010,,Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology,23,6,341-351,,10.1016/j.jpag.2010.03.007,,#291,Blank 2010,,
School-based teenage pregnancy prevention programs: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials,"Bennett, S. E.; Assefi, N. P.","We compared school-based abstinence-only programs with those including contraceptive information (abstinence-plus) to determine which has the greatest impact on teen pregnancy. The United States has one of the highest rates of teen pregnancy in the industrialized world. Programs aimed at reducing the rate of teen pregnancy include a myriad of approaches including encouraging abstinence, providing education about birth control, promoting community service activities, and teaching skills to cope with peer pressure. We systematically reviewed all published randomized controlled trials of secondary-school-based teen pregnancy prevention programs in the United States that used sexual behavior, contraceptive knowledge, contraceptive use, and pregnancy rates as outcomes. © 2005 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

State policy and teen childbearing: A review of research studies,"Beltz, M. A.; Sacks, V. H.; Moore, K. A.; Terzian, M.","Teen childbearing is affected by many individual, family, and community factors; however, another potential influence is state policy. Rigorous studies of the relationship between state policy and teen birth rates are few in number but represent a body of knowledge that can inform policy and practice. This article reviews research assessing associations between state-level policies and teen birth rates, focusing on five policy areas: access to family planning, education, sex education, public assistance, and access to abortion services. Overall, several studies have found that measures related to access to and use of family planning services and contraceptives are related to lower state-level teen birth rates. These include adolescent enrollment in clinics, minors' access to contraception, conscience laws, family planning expenditures, and Medicaid waivers. Other studies, although largely cross-sectional analyses, have concluded that policies and practices to expand or improve public education are also associated with lower teen birth rates. These include expenditures on education, teacher-to-student ratios, and graduation requirements. However, the evidence regarding the role of public assistance, abortion access, and sex education policies in reducing teen birth rates is mixed and inconclusive. These conclusions must be viewed as tentative because of the limited number of rigorous studies that examine the relationship between state policy and teen birth rates over time. Many specific policies have only been analyzed by a single study, and few findings are based on recent data. As such, more research is needed to strengthen our understanding of the role of state policies in teen birth rates.

The effect of long-acting reversible contraception on rapid repeat pregnancy in adolescents: A review,"Baldwin, M. K.; Edelman, A. B.","Repeat pregnancy within 2 years of a previous birth or abortion occurs in approximately 35% of recently pregnant female adolescents. The majority of these pregnancies are classified as unintended with about half ending in births and the remainder in abortions. Rapid repeat pregnancy (RRP) is associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and continues a cycle of economic deprivation for young women and their families. Immediately following a pregnancy, most young women report an intention to avoid pregnancy in the near future, but many change their minds or become ambivalent within months. Lack of contraceptive use is more common among those teens that resume sexual intercourse earlier, live with a male partner, had a preterm delivery, or had an intended teen pregnancy. Adolescents who do not initiate a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method (intrauterine device or contraceptive implant) have up to a 35 times increased risk of RRP compared with their peers using LARC. Risk of RRP is decreased when LARC methods are initiated earlier after an abortion or within the postpartum period. This review will focus on the prevalence of RRP, the risk factors for RRP, and the effectiveness of strategies to reduce unintended RRP including counseling and early initiation of long-acting contraceptive methods. © 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

"Intervention Now to Eliminate Repeat Unintended Pregnancy in Teenagers (INTERUPT): A systematic review of intervention effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and qualitative and realist synthesis of implementation factors and user engagement","Aslam, R. W.; Hendry, M.; Booth, A.; Carter, B.; Charles, J. M.; Craine, N.; Edwards, R. T.; Noyes, J.; Ntambwe, L. I.; Pasterfield, D.; Rycroft-Malone, J.; Williams, N.; Whitaker, R.","Background: Unintended repeat conceptions can result in emotional, psychological and educational harm to young women, often with enduring implications for their life chances. This study aimed to identify which young women are at the greatest risk of repeat unintended pregnancies; which interventions are effective and cost-effective; and what are the barriers to and facilitators for the uptake of these interventions. Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods systematic review which included meta-analysis, framework synthesis and application of realist principles, with stakeholder input and service user feedback to address this. We searched 20 electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica database, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts and Research Papers in Economics, to cover a broad range of health, social science, health economics and grey literature sources. Searches were conducted between May 2013 and June 2014 and updated in August 2015. Results: Twelve randomised controlled trials (RCTs), two quasi-RCTs, 10 qualitative studies and 53 other quantitative studies were identified. The RCTs evaluated psychosocial interventions and an emergency contraception programme. The primary outcome was repeat conception rate: the event rate was 132 of 308 (43%) in the intervention group versus 140 of 289 (48%) for the control group, with a non-significant risk ratio (RR) of 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-1.08]. Four studies reported subsequent birth rates: 29 of 237 (12%) events for the intervention arm versus 46 out of 224 (21%) for the control arm, with an RR of 0.60 (95% CI 0.39-0.93). Many repeat conceptions occurred in the context of poverty, low expectations and aspirations and negligible opportunities. Qualitative and realist evidence highlighted the importance of context, motivation, future planning and giving young women a central and active role in the development of new interventions. Conclusions: Little or no evidence for the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of any of the interventions to reduce repeat pregnancy in young women was found. Qualitative and realist evidence helped to explain gaps in intervention design that should be addressed. More theory-based, rigorously evaluated programmes need to be developed to reduce unintended repeat pregnancy in young women. Trial registration: PROSPERO, CRD42012003168.
